# Network Design

## Goals
- Keep the lab understandable and supportable by one administrator
- Segment servers and clients enough to demonstrate control and least privilege
- Avoid unnecessary complexity that does not add learning value

## Planned networks
Document the VMware virtual networks, subnets, and routing approach here once finalized.

## Firewall and routing
Document any routing VM, firewall rules, and management access approach here.
